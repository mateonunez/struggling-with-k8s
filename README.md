# What the F**K is K8S?

> I don't know.

## Minikube

*Minikube is usually used just for local setup and internal testing.*

But the thing I know is that you should to start these commands:

Install `minikube`.

[Of course I put the official documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

So `kubectl` is a dependency of minikube then you shouldn't install it.

```bash
> minikube
> kubectl
```

Ok now start your local minikluster.

```bash
> minikube start
```

Now just wait to see the magic people done for you.

After the preparation, check your k8s nodes:

```bash
> kubectl get nodes
```

The output should be something like this:

```bash
NAME       STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION
minikube   Ready    control-plane,master   4m18s   v1.23.3
```

What about the **minikube** status?

```bash
> minikube status
```

```bash
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
**kubelet: Running**
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
```

## Kubectl

Now gonna create my first **Pod** (in your local environment you don't create a Pod, but you create a deployment, that it's a Pod abstraction), following the output of `kubectl create` documentation.


```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment --image=nginx
```

Verify your deployment

```bash
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   0/1     1            0           19s
```

Now check your **pods**

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-794f656f8b-ff2bk   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          52s
````

If your pods is still no running, just wait for a second and re-run the `get pods` command.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-794f656f8b-ff2bk   1/1     Running   0          99s
```

What about my replicas pod? (never work directly on replicas, neither update, delete or create. just work on deployments)

```bash
$ kubectl get replicaset
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-deployment-794f656f8b   1         1         1       3m1s
```

- Deploys Manages a ReplicaSet
- A ReplicaSet mannages a Pod
- A pod is an abstraction of your a container

### Editing a deployment

```bash
kubectl edit deployment nginx-deployment
```

This command will return you the `yaml` deployment configuration file so you can edit whetever you want and save the file.

After editing check your pods

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-6bbc464978-4xd9l   0/1     Running                 0      11s
nginx-deployment-794f656f8b-ff2bk   1/1     Terminating             0      10m
```

As you can see the **Status** columns indicates that the old Pod is being terminating and the other one with the changes made is running.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-6bbc464978-4xd9l   1/1     Running   0          75s
```

> Now the old **Pod** is gone.

What about my Replicas?

```bash
$ kubectl get replicaset
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-deployment-6bbc464978   1         1         1       3m6s
nginx-deployment-794f656f8b   0         0         0       13m
```

The old **ReplicaSet** has no more **Pods** and the new one has been automatically created.

### Debugging Pods

> Definitely one of the commands I will use the most....

```bash 
$ kubectl logs nginx-deployment-6bbc464978-4xd9l
```

The output is empty because `nginx` not logged data yet. So I gonna create another deployment, just for test.

```bash
kubectl create deployment mongo-deployment --image=mongo
```

Check your **Pods**:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
mongo-deployment-7994f64674-llvx5   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          9s
nginx-deployment-6bbc464978-4xd9l   1/1     Running             0          7m35s
```

And know check your logs.

```bash
$ kubectl logs mongo-deployment-7994f64674-llvx5
Error from server (BadRequest): container "mongo" in pod "mongo-deployment-7994f64674-llvx5" is waiting to start: ContainerCreating
```

Probably the most useless log I ever seen. So I wait for a minute that k8s finish for create the container.

Meanwhile I'll describe the **pod**

```bash
$ kubectl describe pod mongo-deployment-7994f64674-llvx5

> After 4m13s minutes

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mongo-deployment-7994f64674-llvx5   1/1     Running   0          4m13s
nginx-deployment-6bbc464978-4xd9l   1/1     Running   0          11m

$ kubectl logs mongo-deployment-7994f64674-llvx5
{"t":{"$date":"2022-05-29T12:07:18.054+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"CONTROL",  "id":23285,   "ctx":"-","msg":"Automatically disabling TLS 1.0, to force-enable TLS 1.0 specify --sslDisabledProtocols 'none'"}

{"t":{"$date":"2022-05-29T12:07:18.067+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"NETWORK",  "id":4915701, "ctx":"main","msg":"Initialized wire specification","attr":{"spec":{"incomingExternalClient":{"minWireVersion":0,"maxWireVersion":13},"incomingInternalClient":{"minWireVersion":0,"maxWireVersion":13},"outgoing":{"minWireVersion":0,"maxWireVersion":13},"isInternalClient":true}}}

... bla bla bla
```

Another way to debug a Pod is running the `exec` command. By this way you could interact with the pod.

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it mongo-deployment-7994f64674-llvx5 -- bin/bash
root@mongo-deployment-7994f64674-llvx5:/#
```

> Now you can erase all data ðŸ˜ˆ

### Deleting a Deployment

```bash
$ kubectl delete deployment mongo-deployment
deployment.apps "mongo-deployment" deleted

$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-6bbc464978-4xd9l   1/1     Running   0          24m

$ kubectl get replicaset
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-deployment-6bbc464978   1         1         1       24m
nginx-deployment-794f656f8b   0         0         0       34m
```

### Apply from a file

> Commands are beautiful and useful, but bro. I'm lazy. Now I gonna create all mi configuration files.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.16
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

This is how `nginx-deployment.yaml` file looks like.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml 
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created
```

And after that the magic is done.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-7956bd8bb9-dsvqp   1/1     Running   0          12s
```

> I'm so excited right now.

K8s automatic detect when to create or update a deployment. Now I'm gonna set 2 replicas for my Deployment.


```bash
$ vim nginx-deployment.yaml
```

> Change the replicas from 1 to 2 and re-apply your changes

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml 
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment configured

$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-7956bd8bb9-dsvqp   1/1     Running   0          4m36s
nginx-deployment-7956bd8bb9-tx2jr   1/1     Running   0          78s

$ kubectl get deployments
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   2/2     2            2           4m51s

$ kubectl get replicaset
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-deployment-7956bd8bb9   2         2         2       3m39s
```

K8s updated my deployment and set the replicas from 1 to 2.
